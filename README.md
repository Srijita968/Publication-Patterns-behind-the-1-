This article explores economic inequality as a fractal, self-replicating phenomenon. Using global and Indian wealth data, it shows how inequality persists across scales—from nations to elites—revealing that development changes its form, not its existence.
# Fractal Inequality: How Wealth Replicates Across Economies

# Overview
This project explores economic inequality as a fractal, self-replicating phenomenon using data from India and global economies.

# Key Ideas
- Inequality follows a fractal (self-similar) structure, repeating across economic scales—from countries to classes to individuals.
- Wealth concentration is nested within elites: the top 10% contains the top 1%, which further concentrates into the top 0.1% and 0.01%.
- Economic development changes the form and visibility of inequality, but not its structural existence.
- Underdeveloped economies may show smaller absolute gaps, yet the relative dominance of top groups remains disproportionately high.
- Income inequality acts as a compounding mechanism, gradually transforming unequal flows into long-term wealth concentration.
- Traditional measures (Gini, Lorenz) capture magnitude; the fractal approach explains the recursive persistence of inequality.
- Inequality propagates upward from micro levels, making it a self-reinforcing system across households, nations, and the globe.
- Effective policy must disrupt inequality at its roots through localized opportunity-building and structural redistribution, not just top-down approaches.
